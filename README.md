This is a React-based user management app that allows users to be created, edited, and deleted. The app fetches user data from a JSON placeholder API and displays it in a grid. Each user can be edited or deleted using buttons in the grid.

Components:
App.js
The main App component fetches user data from the API and passes it down to the Box component. It also handles edit and delete button clicks, and updates the user data accordingly.

Box.jsx
The Box component displays a grid of users, with each user represented by a name, ID, edit button, and delete button. When the edit button is clicked, the EditForm component is rendered, allowing the user to be edited.

EditForm.jsx
The EditForm component is a form that allows the user to edit their name. It submits the updated user data to the App component, which updates the user data accordingly.

Form.jsx 
The Form component is not shown in the code, but it is assumed to be a form that allows new users to be created.
